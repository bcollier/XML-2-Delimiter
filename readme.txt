Still under development, probably not ready for public use.  Also not well documented.

But, take a look at the example config file wpdatawork.cfg.  The only one that needs to exist is the stub-meta-history file, the rest are created with the names of your choosing.

Run the program with python xml2delimiter.py

See progress at the log file (that you configured in wpdatawork.cfg).
